                I believe A programmer needs to be see below for reasoning: 
                <ul class="list-group">
                    <li class="list-group-item">A team player</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item">Have an Innate sense of curiosity</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item">An eagerness to learn</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item">And maybe even the ability to write code</li>
                </ul>
                I often find myself wondering what a programmer is? If you ask many people, they'd say one who codes. Okay, that's a good start, but a cryptographer codes, so do that make cryptographers programmers? I'm sure many are, but generally, that would be seen as a different profession. So what more to it is there? Is it someone really good at mathematics? That's sure what I was told in high school, and in my experience, there is an overlap, but if it was just pure mathematics, no one would have felt the need for a neologism. Problem-solving that's what programming is all about, and that certainly is what a programmer does. Unfortunately, that's not unique. Most jobs require problem-solving. A Human Resources worker needs to hire people, and a lawyer needs to solve cases. </br />
                So what is a programmer the Etymology behind the word came from someone who writes program notes which is now an obsolete term, meaning an event organiser? That is something that would require a lot of interaction with people while having a good level of professional knowledge.

            <h2>A Better Vision for Elgar Ward</h2>
            <p>Elgar Ward is a vibrant and diverse community. With thoughtful planning, we can preserve and enhance the quality of life for all residents. I believe our community deserves a strong representative who not only listens but also takes decisive action to protect what makes Elgar special.</p>
            <p>As someone who has lived in Box Hill my entire life, I am committed to preserving our green spaces, supporting local businesses, and ensuring our infrastructure continues to thrive.</p>
            <p>Over the coming weeks and months, I’ll be knocking on doors and connecting with as many residents as possible. Your thoughts and ideas are crucial to shaping the future of our community.</p>
            <p>Together, let’s create a more inclusive, safe, and vibrant future for Elgar Ward.</p>

            <h3>Protecting Our Community</h3>
            <p>We are seeing too many developers profiting from over-supplying cheap, high-density apartments that don’t meet our community's need for space, light, and livability. </p>
               <p> I’ve lived my whole life in this area, and I am passionate about maintaining our lively, family-friendly neighborhood.</p>
            <p>With the right planning, we can keep the Box Hill we know and love – with green spaces, great community infrastructure, and thriving local businesses that support our diverse community.</p>
